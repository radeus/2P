This module programmatically creates a page at /regions

created from this site:
http://scito.ch/content/print-hierarchical-list-taxonomy-vocabulary-terms-page

I still want to make the first level collapsible, or really:
	all parents with children collapsible, with disclosure triangles!


break out products, events, and shops
	only events should have RSS feeds
	make icons for all three folding map, clock?, building?

Maybe add a big world map at the top
Maybe add flags

get rid of the two hard coded vids (5) and use for event types and ?
